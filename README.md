# NightSafe Companion

NightSafe Companion is a project designed to provide safety and peace of mind, not only for women but for anyone who needs to travel home at night. Leveraging the power of the Zepp OS platform, this project combines hardware and software to create a reliable companion for your nightly journeys.

## Features

- **Zeus CLI:** Built using the Zeus CLI for Zepp OS, this project integrates seamlessly with your Zepp Balance watch.
- **Real-time Navigation:** Utilizes HTTP requests and the Google Places API to help users find the nearest open and safe locations they can visit in their vicinity.
- **Sound Speaker:** Includes a built-in sound speaker that can be used to play soothing sounds, emergency alerts, or even act as a personal alarm.
- **Customizable for All:** While designed with safety in mind, the NightSafe Companion is not limited to any specific gender or group. It's open for anyone who values safety during nighttime travels.

## How It Works

1. The user activates the NightSafe Companion on their Zepp Balance watch.
2. The project makes HTTP requests to the Google Places API to identify nearby open and safe locations such as restaurants, cafes, or gas stations.
3. It presents the user with a list of these nearby locations along with navigation directions.
4. The sound speaker can be used to play soothing sounds during the journey or act as a personal alarm if needed.
